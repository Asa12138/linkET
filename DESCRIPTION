Description: The 'linkET' package can be used to visualize simply and directly a
    matrix heatmap based on 'ggplot2'. It provides a solution for reordering the 
    correlation matrix, displaying the different significance level on the plot and 
    other details. The most important parts, it also provides a graphical display of 
    any correlation analysis and their combination (such as Mantel test, Partial 
    correlation analysis, and so on).
